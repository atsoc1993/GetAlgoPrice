The files in this repository contains a method for fetching the price of Algorand by querying the local state of the ALGO/USDC Tinyman pool against the Tinyman router application.

One example shows fetching the price off-chain, and the other on-chain via smart contract logic.

The same logic can be applied via smart contract by using the AppLocal opcode.
